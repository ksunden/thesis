\section{Introduction}  % =========================================================================

Linear spectroscopies: absorbance, reflectancce, raman

Nonlinear techniques


Comparison to NMR
  "Cat state" spectroscopies

Coupling

Time domain techniques
 - interferometric
 - limitation therin
    -bandwidth
    -local oscillator
 - pump-probe and photon echo

Frequency domain approaches
 - various names, multi resonant, floquet state
 - no need for broadband source
 - homodyne detection
 - matching FID to coherence lifetimes
 - Use multiple light sources, generate new light at sum or difference frequencies
   - "I do math with light"
 - Raman and CARS

Challenges
 artifacts: absorptive, pulse effects, window effects, group/phase velocity mismatch
 many moving parts

Experimental setup
 - two or more light sources
 - controllable time delay to ensure temporal overlap and provide delay as a discriminating axis of control
 - focusing optics to ensure spatial overlap
