\subsection{Optical Design}

\subsection{Hardware Selection}
"homebuilt" approach
standard stepper motors
iterative process
  - Replace newport motor with thorlabs KDC101, K-Cube controller
  - Additional motor for grating
  - Array detector

\section{Stepper Control Box}  % ===================================================================

rpi
adafruit hats
custom interrupt boards
 - show circuits, pinouts
Power supply
Box constructed of metal base, Al posts, clear plastic for 2 sides + top
  - 3d printed panels for mounting I/O
  - cutout for rpi I/O

\section{Delay stages}  % ===================================================================

3d printed part for connector and interrupt
Machined base for precise height
  - consideration for thermal expansion for parts in direct support of optics
  - Base below stage
  - purchased thorlabs stage
  - plate to attach mirrors
Mounting and coupling the motors: a journey
  - Originally, 3D printed part included motor mounting, but this proved problemeatic
  - Getting motors to spin was easy, but locked up when coupled to stage
