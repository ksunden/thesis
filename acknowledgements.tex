To John, thank you for being the kind, patient advisor any graduate student could hope for.

When I asked John to join the group, he asked me why I wanted to join.
My answer at that time was "Honestly, it's the people in the group".
That answer rings true even as the composition of the group has changed.
For that, this dissertation is dedicated to all of the Wright Group members.

To Blaise, thank you for your persistent pursuit of technical excellence.
Thank you for starting so many of the projects that I got to work on in the Wright Group.
But most of all, thank you for your friendship.

To Hannah, thank you for always knowing how to make me smile.

To Liz, thank you for your steadfast friendship.

To Laura, thank you for encouraging my interest in research.

To Tom and Dan, thank you for welcoming me into a community.

To my parents and Casey, thank you for being the kind, supportive family you are.

To all of those who contribute to and maintain Open Source scientific software, your work is appreciated and enables many great discoveries.
